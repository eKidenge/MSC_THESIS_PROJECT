## Executive Summary

This research develops an AI-optimized traffic control framework specifically designed for Kenyan urban transportation networks. The system integrates reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, and conventional control methods within a simulation environment to optimize traffic signal timing, reduce congestion, and minimize environmental impact. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods, with up to 28% reduction in average wait times and 30% improvement in fuel efficiency.
